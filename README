This is not a software project but a card game.  It's an attempt at a strategy war game using common household items instead of expensive gaming pieces.  Still a work in progress.

The name is a play on Tactics Ogre and the fact that a deck of cards has jokers.  I'm tired and it's a lame pun.  If you have a less lame or an astonishingly more egregiously lame pun I'll be happy to rename the project.
